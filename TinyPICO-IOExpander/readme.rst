TinyPICO IO Expander Library
============================

This is a library for the TinyPICO IO Expander that groups all of it's functionality into a single wrapper.

The library comes with a range of examples that cover all aspects of the shields functionality.

Special thanks to Adam Keher for helping put this together!
